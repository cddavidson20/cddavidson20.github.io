    <h3>Goals of taking this course:</h3>
    <li>Learn more about the interaction between the front-end and back-end.</li>
    <li>Also I was hoping to learn about front-end frameworks like ReactJS.</li>
    <h3>My favorite thing:</h3>
    <li>I have a <strong>Belgian Malinois</strong> named Izza that can do some awesome tricks. I am planning to compete with her in AKC competitions.</li>
